        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Our version of miso noodle soup in a jar was inspired by recipes on TikTok for miso soup in a jar.
            Try this heat-and-eat recipe for a warming main to prep and tote all season long. 
            Use jars labeled “microwave-safe” (check the bottoms) and never microwave the lids.
