        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Our version of miso noodle soup in a jar was inspired by recipes on TikTok for miso soup in a jar.
            Try this heat-and-eat recipe for a warming main to prep and tote all season long. 
            Use jars labeled “microwave-safe” (check the bottoms) and never microwave the lids.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>12 ounces extra-firm tofu</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sliced green onions</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white miso paste</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable stock base</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups cooked rice vermicelli noodles</li>
            <li>1 cup thinly sliced shiitake mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 cup thinly sliced baby bok choy</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cut tofu into 1/2-inch planks. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
                Cook tofu, turning halfway through, until golden, 6 to 8 minutes. 
                Cut tofu into cubes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir together green onions, miso paste, garlic, stock base, and ginger in a small bowl.
                Divide evenly among 3 microwave-safe pint-size canning jars with lids. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Layer evenly with rice vermicelli noodles, tofu, mushrooms, and bok choy. Chill, covered, up to 5 days. 
                To serve, see “Heat and Eat”. Garnish with sliced green onions. 
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Heat and Eat</h2>
        <p>
            Let jar stand at room temperature 10 minutes or run under warm water 1 minute. 
            Add water (about 1 cup) to ingredients in jar until nearly full. Microwave without the lid for 3 minutes. 
            Carefully screw on lid (jar will be very hot). Let stand 5 minutes. Invert jar to combine ingredients. 
            Eat out of jar or transfer to a bowl to serve.
